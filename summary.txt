     Needed functions -------------------------------/

TODO:
1. Lexical addressing
  - With this, the env in C can be an array (faster than using cons for the C env)
2. Open coding primitives
3. Scheme library
4. More C base
5. Needed functions
   - We can do a full program analysis and so can have a binary with only the needed functions
6. Types (?)
